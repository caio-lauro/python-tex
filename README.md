# PyTeX (Python LaTeX)
This is a simple project that conveys the simplicity of python to LaTeX, using Object Oriented Programming (OOP). \
In sumary, this project allows the user to write LaTeX documents using the python language in the most "pythonic" way.

## Usage
To use PyTeX, one must get `pytex.py` and add it to the root of the project and import it. For now, there is no way of installing it to your machine.
